## The Problem<a id="qlink"></a>

The recent snowfall as counted by the snow lysimeter on UPLMET seems too be way too much for the site and given its past history. As it stands, the history of snow in millimeters on UPLMET (here just showing from 2004 on) is: 

| YEAR | on UPLMET | on CENMET |
| --- | ---|
|2004 |  1290.9 |  1310.1 |
|2005 | 1613.9 | 1518.4 |
|2006 | 1611.9 | 1712.9 |
|2007 |  2152.0 | 1785.1 |
|2008 |   1804.9 | 1259.4 |
|2009 |  1950.0 | 2037.6 |
|2010 |  1781.0 | 2418.6 |
|2011 |  1663.6 | 1463.9 |
|2012 |  2796.1 | 2234.2 |
|2013 |  2240.2 | 1063.7 |
|2014  | 3885.5 | 2672.6 |

So this most recent year is a lot more than the previous, and more than the comparison station.

## The Approach <a id="approach"></a>
With this in mind, we wanted to look at the data in comparison to the precip from the same years. The approach was to gather and synchronize sums of monthly precip for both sites, and graph them.

Simple queries are excuted against MS04303 and MS04309 to select and sum the data.
