<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#qlink">The Problem</a> and <a href="#approach">The Approach</a> to understanding the implications of differences between five minute and daily values are outlined here. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#atmax">AIR TEMPERATURE Maximums</a> from daily data (instantaneous measurements as we have been getting in the past) were all within less than one degree of difference from air temperature maximums taken from getting the maximum of the five minute values of the day. Sometimes the time of maximum was a little different than the closest five minute interval (if there were several very hot intervals in the day). Both the instantaneous and five-minute maximums were about 60 percent greater than the daily mean. At fifteen minutes, using only the most recent data, there was good agreement between the methods, however, our past analysis indicated that there is more discrepancy between fifteen minute maximums and five minute maximums than within a five minute window. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#rhmax">RELATIVE HUMIDITY Maximums</a>. Differences between the relative humidity maximums from the daily data and from the five minute data were generally less than 12 percent. However, the maximum relative humidity is also well constrained at 100 percent. Between the maximum relative humidity and the mean is generally less than 20 percent difference, however this trend is not as strong across sites as it was with temperature. There is more variability between daily (instantaneous) and daily (five minute) data in relative humidity than in temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#dpmax">DEW POINT Maximums</a> depend on consistency between maximums of air temperature and of relative humidity. Since there is a chance that one or both of these will not be similar to the five minute measurement, the dew point calculation is also affected. Since relative humidity is the more variable of the two, in general, if the maximum relative humidity of the day differs significantly from the found maximum in the five minute data, the maximum dew point of the day will also differ. Another issue is that sometimes dew point is &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; even when both relative humidity and air temperature are off (see the <a href="http://dataronin.github.io/metQC/2015/02/09/outline_of_flags_and_problems_on_portal.html">flags</a> document). A third problem is that if error occurs in one of the component measurements, the dew point might be predicted to be greater than the temperature of the day (which is impossible). The majority of dew points maximums were less than two degrees different than the five minute maximums. The difference between the dew point maximum and the daily mean dew point was about 40 percent for the instantaneous method and 32 percent for the five-minute data method. I attribute that difference to when dew point was computed despite one or both of its components being missing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#atmin">AIR TEMPERATURE Minimums</a> from the daily data (instantaneous&hellip;) were also within less than one degree of difference from the minimums taken from the minimum five minute mean of the day. The minimums were about 40 percent less than the daily mean. In general, there was less variability between minimums than maximums. On PRIMET at 450 m there were several outlier measurements. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#rhin">RELATIVE HUMIDITY Minimums</a> The minimums from the daily data for relative humidity can be very different than the five minute minimums, particularly when the five minute minimums are at 100 percent humidity and the daily minimum has displayed as value which is not 100 percent humidity. While the minimum five minute mean humidity suggests that the lowest humidity is about 37 less than the mean over the course of the day, the daily method indicates that it is closer to 44 percent. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#dpmin">DEW POINT Minimums</a> In general, it was seen that the average difference between dew point minimum by methods was about 1.5 degrees C. Similar to the dew point maximums, error propogating from air temperature and (strongly from) relative humidity affect the minimum dew point. When using the five minute method, the minimum dew point was usually about 29 percent lower than the daily mean dew point; when using the instantaneous method it was about 33 percent lower. The most nefarious problem with dew points is the calculation of the dew point in the log even when relative humidity or air temperature are missing. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the bottom of this document are a few more summary take home points, the body of this document is examples of problems and charts.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem"><a name="user-content-the-problem" href="#the-problem" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>The Problem<a id="qlink"></a></h2>
<p>Data collected in the past included the instantaneous minimum and maximums of air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed and direction (only maximum for wind) on a single day. This information is no longer being collected. Recently, we have used the five- or fifteen- minute minimum or maximum from the day to approximate these instantaneous values. But what do we lose if we choose to not capture these values?</p>
<p>Example (hypothetical):</p>
<ul>
<li>Instantaneous maximum is &ldquo;37.89&rdquo; and occurs at 12:34:05</li>
<li>Five- minute preceding temperature is &ldquo;36.35&rdquo; at 12:30:00 and following is &ldquo;35.87&rdquo; at 12:35:00. </li>
</ul>

<p>The table below describes the extent of the data used in this analysis.  The DAYS SHARED attribute is the number of days I used during which both five- and daily- data acquisitions appeared to be operational. During these times there were no long &ldquo;streaks&rdquo; of values gathered labelled as &ldquo;NULL&rdquo; and the values fell within an earthly range, here defined at greater than -50 C or less than 50 C for any air temperature. The LAST GATHERED attribute is the last day from which I collected data. There may be a few days of good data following this date.</p>

<p>The tables that follow describe results generated for a few stations. <br />
I did not address here the aspirated sensors for air temperature. After bring in, merging, and <a href="#outliers">filtering outliers</a>, I computed a basic set of metrics, and fed them into histograms to create probability distributions to exemplify and compare the behaviors of each set.</p>
<ul>
<li>date-time for the daily date</li>
<li>maximums on the daily</li>
<li>minimums on the daily</li>
<li>maximums on the five minutes (max of five minute means for a day)</li>
<li>minimums on the five minutes (min of five minute means for a day)</li>
<li>difference between corresponding daily and five minute maxes (absolute value difference)</li>
<li>difference between corresponding daily and five minute minimums (absolute value difference)</li>
<li>percent of difference between the daily max and the daily mean </li>
<li>percent of difference between the max of the five minute means for the day and the mean of five minute means for the day</li>
<li>percent of difference between the daily min and the daily mean</li>
<li>percent of difference between the minimum of the daily five minute means and the daily mean</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="outliers"></a> When generating histograms, I used 5 evenly spaced bins. In some cases, one or two values which were clearly erroneous for either of the two data sets were removed as they greatly skewed the distribution. When this removal fell well into the realm of impossibility, I noted the date and value and then removed it. When it was potentially questionable, I noted it for further exploration (see the <a href="#atmax">PRIMET maximums</a> for an example).</p>
<p>Additionally, I independently validated 3 randomly selected days by randomly selecting a row using a random number generator between the collected data and the daily data being reported on the Portal. I also checked that the times of minimum and times of maximums reported on Portal for the five minute observation were the same as the ones that encompassed the maximum (or minimum) daily variables taken from instantaneous measurements daily temperature come from METDAT off of the daily (440) table. The key problem I found in this was that observations between 23:55 PM and Midnight could get assigned to the wrong time stamp, due to the timing discrepancy between the 2400 as midnight method versus the 0000 as midnight method. Although I initially thought I had found an example of this, I was incorrect; however, it did open my eyes to the fact that this error could exist, and would result in the daily minimum or maximum value being cast to the prior day, should it not be taken using the daily synopsis technique. In short, this is an inconsistency between the two methods that will not be resolved unless the TmStamp is reformated in either the newer or older data sets. </p>

<li><strong> Note: </strong> When calculating the average difference between the daily mean value and the daily max or min value, I used the median rather than the statistical mean, as often one outlier that I could not immediately determine if real or incorrect would skew the distribution too much. </li>

<li>
<p>The daily maximum temperatures are on average 70.71 percent greater than the mean temperature for the day as calculated on the daily summary</p>

<p>Tables like this contain the boundaries of the grouping bins in a histogram, the count of the values encompassed by that bin, and the percent of the total values in that bin.

<p>At H15MET, the percent difference between the 15 minute daily temperatures as the maximum of the day versus the instantaneous maximum of the day showed that only one value had a difference of more than 0.2 degrees. This value came from the day 2013-02-01, and the daily instruction appears to be incorrect, showing a maximum value of 23.25 C (and a minimum value of -85 C).</p>
<p>The average difference between maximum and mean air temperature for a day was 51 percent for both methods at H15MET.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of relative humidity maximums, collected from several sensors:</p>
<p>At the 150 m height, RHCEN01:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The maximum difference between five- minute relative humidity maximum and daily relative humidity maximum was 55.13 percent and occured on 2014-09-11.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on this day, the daily measurement was 96.3 percent for the maximum while the five-minute measurement was only 40.3 percent. The value of 96.3 percent is more similar to the other measurements on this sensor during that week, which were also in the 90&rsquo;s. This value is also more similar to the measured values of 100.0 on PRIMET on this day at 150 m for the daily and 95.5 on this day for the five-minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On average, the maximum relative humidity is only 8 percent greater than the mean for both the daily and five minute methods on CENMET 150 at 150 m. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After removing outliers, 91 percent of daily maximum values and maximum values for the day from five minute means are within 10 percent of one another. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The graph below shows the distribution of maximums on VANMET 150 before the outliers are removed. <strong> Please be aware that the y-axis should be multiplied by 10 to get an appropriate probability.</strong> I.e. prior to outlier removal, about 82 percent of maximum values were still between 0 and 10 percent relative humidity of one another. I am not sure why the histogramming function is generating this error, but it is internal and I will look into it. </p>

<li>
<p>Comparing the 150 m and 450 m height, it is evident that when there is a large difference between the relative humidity maximum measured on the daily measurement versus the daily maximum as computed from the five minute means, this difference is often due to an error that is sensor specific. For example, the maximum difference between the two methods occurs on the CENMET relative humidity sensors on 2014-09-11. On this day, the daily measurement is 87.7 percent relative humidity whereas the five-minute measurement is 21 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Air temperature on this day were also problematic and removed from the data, and measurements of the difference in humidities on VANMET and PRIMET are more similar to the 87.7 percent. Furthermore, the rest of the week also has a relative humidity that is greater than 60 percent for daily measurements and five minute measurements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average percent difference in relative humidity maximums from the mean relative humidity is 16 percent in both the five minute and daily methods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Relative humidity maximums on PRIMET (a discussion):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the 450 m sensor does not appear to be functional for a long duration of the time period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>based on observations at 150 m, </p>
</li>
<li>The greatest difference between the five-minute and instantaneous maximums was 12 % on 2014-09-12. On this day the daily value exceeded the 5 minute value at 95 percent versus 83 percent. </li>
<li>92 percent of differences between methods were less than 12 percent. </li>
</ul>
<p>Relative humidity maximums on VANMET (a discussion):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>on VANMET, the same 2014-09-11 emerges for having discrepancies between the five minute maximum and daily maximum values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, the mean difference between the maximum and median relative humidity at VANMET is 20.5 degrees in the maximum values from daily and 20.4 in the version in the five minute data; this may be within acceptable tolerance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only 67 percent of vanmets values are within 10 percent of the mean.</p>
</li>

<p>Since dew point is affected by air temperature and relative humidity, dew point maximums also follow these trends. If the quality of relative humidity and air temperature are controlled, the dewpoint will follow the same. </p>
<p>The challenge is that sometimes, if air temperature and relative humidity are not being calculated, dew point is calculated anyway. In these cases, the dew point readings do not reflect actual observations, but spew from the loggers. Thus, the daily maximum and minimum values, as well as the five minute values, could either or both be tainted by these fake values. Here is an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum difference between the daily maximum from 5 minute values versus the instantaneous maximum was 18.9 degrees due to this erroneous value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of a large difference between dew points on VANMET  at 150 m at 5 minutes versus its daily corrresponding value. In this case, dew point was being thrown e</p>

<p>What will be problematic for calculations is if the dew point computed appears to be greater than the temperature of the day because erroneous values are thrown into the temperature data extensively.</p>
<p>Here is an image of dew point maximums differences on PRIMET at 150 m prior to the removal of that cold day outlier. Once that outlier was removed, the largest difference was 1.43 C.</p>

<p>Similar to PRIMET, VANMET at 150 m showed the largest outlier of 98 percent difference on 2014-06-13 (a day which was also problematic for PRIMET at 150m). However, even after removal the largest difference between the daily minimum relative humidity percent and the minimum percent from five minute intervals for the day is 67 percent relative humidity decrease. </p>
<p>In short, the differences between the daily minimum relative humidities and the minimum of the five-minute mean relative humidities are very different. </p>
<p>For the five-minute method, the difference between the five minute minimum relative humidity and the mean is approximately 37, for the daily method, the difference is closer to 44 percent. </p>
<p>An interesting test I looked at on this site was where the five minute minimum relative humidity was 100 %, was the daily minimum relative humidity also 100%? If this was true, then it might indicate either real, high humidity or instrument error which appeared that the 100 percent value was &ldquo;stuck&rdquo;&ndash; however, in all but three (of 15 cases) cases, on days where the five minute minimum is 100 percent, the daily minimum is actually much lower.</p>
<p>Below, the dotted blue line is the minimum relative humidity daily course from the daily minimums, the blue squares are when the daily minimum is 100 percent humidity, and the red squares are when the five minute minimums are 100 percent. </p>
<iframe src= "http://bl.ocks.org/dataRonin/63d7f6595a57033dceb8" width="800" height="600" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>In short this shows that the daily minimum may indeed read much lower than the five minute minimum relative humidity. </p>

<p>The dewpoint on VANMET also showed a greater magnitude in the discrepancy between the five minute values and the daily values when there was a notable difference between the two methods.</p>
<p>In general, the quality of air temperature is better known and more stable than that of relative humidity, and it is of a smaller magnitude, so errors given to due point usually come in tandem with errors in one of the values of relative humidity. The second case that occurs is when dewpoint is measured even though air temperature and relative humidity were not (a faulty log), and therefore comparing random values to random values results in random differences.</p>
<p>Here is an example of where I found dan erroneous minimum in the daily dataset of -72 dew point. </p>
